Scheduler?
  event loop
Union filesystem / Ephemeral FS or mount
CPU -> Assembly -> Language -> OS? or Fake it?

> Ideas
------------------------------------------------------------
  keywords: snare, tangle, knot, snarl, skein, knit, trap
    knots + threads? (too far)
  mesh - shell
  cat images (ascii?)
    mixed mode graphics + ansi?
  vulnerabilities based on version
  vulnerability list
  scan tool (meshmap) - automatically populated
  Crazy uncle gifts you the laptop
  Rootkits and malware already on some nodes
  Kathyscript?
  messageboards, muds, bbs, door games
  modular code for version swaps
  GPIO / Misc Devices and Sensors
    CPU Temp Sensors + Fans = crash
  overclock
  random number generator instruction
  encrypt / decrypt instruction
  devices using shared memory based on event emitters
  classify memory regions (rom, io, ram)
    Address space abstraction?
  cpu modes / rings
  clock ticks instead of cycles
    tick as an idealized unit of time

Cracking
NOPs are often involved when cracking software that checks for serial numbers, specific hardware or software requirements, presence or absence of hardware dongles, etc. This is accomplished by altering functions and subroutines to bypass security checks and instead simply return the expected value being checked for. Because most of the instructions in the security check routine will be unused, these would be replaced with NOPs, thus removing the software's security functionality without attracting any attention.

Security exploits
The NOP opcode can be used to form a NOP slide, which allows code to execute when the exact value of the instruction pointer is indeterminate (e.g., when a buffer overflow causes a function's return address on the stack to be overwritten).
